                    <h3>Esteemed Delegates,</h3>
                    <h3>
                        I am thrilled to welcome you to VarankMUN'24, a prestigious conference that promises to be a
                        memorable experience for all participants. As the Secretary General, I am honored to guide you
                        through this journey of diplomacy, debate, and collaboration. <h3>
                        VarankMUN'24 brings together bright minds from diverse backgrounds, all united by a passion for
                        making a difference. Over these four days, you will have the opportunity to step into the shoes of
                        diplomats, representing various countries and people while engaging in discussions on important
                        global issues. Your unique perspectives and thoughtful contributions will be key to shaping
                        meaningful resolutions and fostering mutual understanding. <h3>
                        At VarankMUN'24, we aim to create an environment where every delegate feels empowered to
                        voice their opinions and engage with one another in a spirit of respect and open-mindedness. Our
                        committees offer a platform for constructive dialogue, critical thinking, and creative problem-
                        solving. You will not only gain valuable insights into the workings of international diplomacy but
                        also develop skills that will serve you well beyond the conference. <h3>
                        Our Academic and Organization teams have worked tirelessly to organize a conference that is
                        both enriching and enjoyable. From engaging committee sessions to networking opportunities, we
                        hope that VarankMUN'24 will be an unforgettable experience for you. I want to express my
                        gratitude for your participation and commitment to this conference. Your enthusiasm and
                        dedication are what make VarankMUN'24 possible. I encourage you to make the most of this
                        opportunity, embrace the challenges, and don’t forget to have fun with your friends.
                        Thank you for being a part of VarankMUN'24. <h3>
